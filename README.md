# School District Analysis 🏫 🐍 🐼
This repository contains an [IPython Notebook]('PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools.ipynb') that uses the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library to analyzes district-wide standardized test results. To showcase trends in academic performance, data is aggregated into the following tables:
* District-wide summary
* By-school summary
* Top performing schools
* Bottom performing schools
* Math scores by grade
* Reading scores by grade
* Scores by school spending
* Scores by school type

## Observable Trends 📈
* `Charter` schools in this district tend to have better overall scores than `District` schools. The top 5 performing schools based on overall passing percentages (math & reading) are all Charter schools, while the bottom 5 performing schools were all District schools. 90% of students at Charter schools were passing overall while only 53% of students at District schools were passing overall.
* School spending per student seemed to correlate with performance. 90% of students attending schools where the per-student spending was above $585 were passing overall. The percentage of passing students declined as school spending decreased.
